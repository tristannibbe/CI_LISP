> (add 1 2)
Type: Integer Value: 3

> (add (neg 2) 2)
Type: Integer Value: 0

> (add (sqrt 4) 4)
Type: Integer Value: 6

> (sub (sqrt 4) (neg 2))
Type: Integer Value: 4

>(sqrt (add 2 2))
Type: Integer Value: 2

> (sqrt (mult 32 2))
Type: Integer Value: 8

>(sub (neg 1000) (abs(neg 1000)))
Type: Integer Value: -2000
